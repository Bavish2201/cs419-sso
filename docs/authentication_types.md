Types of Authentication
===

### ENTERPRISE SINGLE SIGN ON (E-SSO)
This type of system works as a primary authentication, intercepting login requests when required by secondary applications in order to fill out the user and password fields. The E-SSO system allows for interaction with other systems that may disable the login screen.

### WEB SINGLE SIGN-ON (WEB-SSO)
This type of solution only works with applications which can be accessed through the web, and its goal is the authentication of a user on several applications without the need to get identified again.

Access data is intercepted by a proxy server that performs the communication and then transfers the result to the computer that requested it. Unidentified users are redirected to an authentication service, returning a successful login.

### FEDERATED IDENTITY
This type of Single Sign On involves an identity management solution that uses standards to enable applications to identify clients without the need for redundant authentication.

### OPEN ID
Open ID is a decentralised SSO process in which the user identity is stored at a URL that any server can verify.
