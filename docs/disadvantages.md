Disadvantages of SSO
===

1. Using a single password increases the chances of password vulnerability
2. When SSO fails, access to all related systems is lost
3. Identity spoofing in user external accesses
4. Single point of failure

Single high-value target (attracts more attackers)

Necessary information disclosure between trusting site and SSO authority

Side channel attack against authentication step (theoretically; implementation dependent)

Lack of control over your user list

Yet another interface to maintain (added complexity)

You may never know how secure your system is or if there is a breach

Added cost
